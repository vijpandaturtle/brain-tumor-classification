# Brain Tumor Classification

A brain tumor is a collection/mass of cells in the brain. This type of abnormal cell growth in the brain can lead to interference with the regular functions of the brain and even conditions such as cancer. Tumors in the brain are usually detected by a radiologist who uses sophisticated X-ray, CT and MRI machines to image the brain. However, it is hard to find radiologists who are well-trained in every medical facility. So, automating the task of reading brain scans using deep learning is considered a useful pursuit and could help radiologists and doctors become more efficient. The data used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri). The data consists of 3264 MRI images (converted to JPEG format) of patients with 1. glioma tumor 2. meningioma tumor 3. pituitary tumor and 4. no tumor.
